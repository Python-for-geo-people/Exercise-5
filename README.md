# Exercise-5
Exercise 5: Analysing NOAA climate data

## Tasks
1. Read in data file (provided from NOAA climate database)
2. Split into separate files by year (e.g., AA-1926.csv, AA-1927.csv)
3. Loop over all files by year, read data and calculate average temperatures for winter (DJF) and summer (JJA), append year and mean temperature to new data files (summer-avg-temps.csv, winter-avg-temps.csv)
4. Save data files to GitHub for future use (could be a nice dataset to use for plotting. Could plot daily temperatures and seasonal averages with different symbols, possibly add a trendline)

**Is this too much work for one exercise???**
